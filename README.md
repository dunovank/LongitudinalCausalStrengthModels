### LongitudinalCausalStrengthModels

Different models for computing causal strength from longitudinal data. Generally, "_model" files contain functions that perform model computations, and "_simplot" files contain simple simulations and accompanying plots of important results. Source/run the model files before running any simulations.

Models so far:
* Rescorla-Wagner
* âˆ†P
* Power-PC
